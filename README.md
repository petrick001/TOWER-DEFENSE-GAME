# TOWER-DEFENSE-GAME
**Project Description**
We are planning to build a simple Tower Defense game using C++ and the SFML library.  
Our focus is to keep everything simple, using basic shapes (rectangles andd circles) for towers, enemies, and paths.



**Game Approach**
We chose a top-down approach because it is easier to visualize enemies moving along a path and makes tower placement clear for the playerss.



**Why SFML?**
Based on our research and what we learnt from class;
- it is easy to learn and works well with C++.
-  it also handles graphics, sound, and input in one library.
- it is lightweight and perfect for small projects.
- it also Works across platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).


**Game Rules**
These are the following rules we came up with fir the game;
1. The enemies will move along a fixed path.
2. The player will have to place towers along the path.
3. Then the towers attack enemies automatically when in range.
4. If too many enemies reach the end, the player loses.
5. The player wins after defeating all enemy waves.


**Plan for the Look**
- **Enemies**: circles moving along a path.
- **Towers**: squares placed by the player.
- **Path**: rectangles showing enemy route.
- **Bullets/Attacks**: small shapes or lines.
